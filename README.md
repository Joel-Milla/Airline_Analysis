# Airline Analysis Project

This project is part of a data science course focused on using techniques to visualize, analyze and make inferences from data. The purpose of this project is to clean and visualize data to derive insights from a database that contains information about flights.

## Features

- Cleans the data to ensure reliability.
- Utilizes data visualization techniques to explore the relationship between multiple features.
- Applies multiple plots and techniques to make univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to draw conclusions from the data.
